**** IRC Go Bot *****


** This is a bot created in Google's language "Go"
** Currently what it does is join a channel of your preference and server and will allow you to run commands such as 
** "~showtime" then the name of a show, such as "~showtime Sons of Anarchy" this will display information about the show.
** Information is retrieved using the xmlx library and grabs it through tvrage.com however this will change as I've found a better place
** to retrieve the resources.


// I have supplied a compiled XMLX package with this in order for you to easily compile main.go //
// I DID NOT MAKE XMLX, you can find it here on github it is made by exch. //




** TODO: **

-- Add last.fm library and bot commands
-- Create IRC package to handle most requests
-- Allow bot to speak
-- Add admin usage
